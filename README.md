## Development

### Main Tools
- React 18
- Javascript
- CSS
- Visual Studio Code

## Development

### Challenge and Results
- Create cleaen folder structure for custom components with the specific design files
- Using the context API with useReducer to maintain complex state management - provider, useContext, dispatch actions, storing different states. Stored in store folder seperately from components
- Create totally reusable UI elements like the card or input components.
- Using portals and fragments to maintain the DOM and keep it clear. Portal to place modal above the application.
- Using Css modules instead of classnames
- Using all the essential lifecycle hooks like useState, useEffect, useRef, useContext, useReducer
- Having conditional rendering for elements - checking state
- State management solutions - prop-chaining, useContext. In this solution I didn't use Redux, but it may happen that it will have included
- Minimal validation

### Note
- Biggest challenge was that I was very ill during the development, and I could complete it eventually with less focus capability.
- During the development I learnt about Redux, React Query, Axios, little Next.js also.
- Wrote 43 pages in Word about React in Word. So now I have one about React and one about Angular
